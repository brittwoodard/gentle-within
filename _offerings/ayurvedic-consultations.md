  description_html: |
    <p>Each consultation begins with a 75-minute intake, where we explore your unique constitution (dosha) and the imbalances you may be experiencing. You'll receive personalized guidance that may include dietary and lifestyle recommendations, mind-body practices, and gentle shifts aligned with Ayurvedic tradition. Optional follow-up sessions are available for deeper integration and ongoing support.</p>
    <p>You'll also receive a written summary of your plan, including suggestions tailored to your needs and rhythms.</p>
    <p><em>These sessions are offered on a sliding scale of $25–$50 and are part of my supervised training as an Ayurvedic Health Counselor. They are intended for educational and wellness purposes only, and are not a substitute for licensed medical care or psychotherapy. If you're seeking mental health support, I invite you to explore psychotherapy services instead.</em></p>

faq: 
  heading_html: <em>Frequently</em> Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: Are Ayurvedic consultations medical treatment?
     answer_html: |
       <p>No — Ayurvedic consultations are educational and wellness-oriented. They are not a substitute for licensed medical care or psychotherapy. These sessions are offered as part of my training in Ayurveda and are currently available at a sliding scale ($25–$50). If you’re seeking mental health support, please consider booking a psychotherapy session.</p>
   - question: Can I work with you for both therapy and Ayurveda?
     answer_html: |
       <p>It depends. Because of ethical and professional guidelines, I typically keep psychotherapy and Ayurvedic consultations separate. If you’re curious about integrating both approaches, we can discuss your goals during an initial call and determine the best path forward.</p>
   - question: Do you offer virtual or in-person sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>At this time, I offer virtual sessions via a secure, HIPAA-compliant video platform. In-person sessions may be available upon request, depending on location and availability.</p>
   - question: Do you offer sliding scale rates or pro bono sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Yes. I reserve a limited number of sliding scale therapy and Ayurvedic consultation spots for BIPOC, and low-income clients. Please inquire about current availability during your consultation call.</p>
   - question: How do I get started?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Head over to the Contact page to reach out. Let me know which service you're interested in, and I’ll follow up with next steps or a link to book a free consultation call.</p>
