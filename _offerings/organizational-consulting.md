  heading_html: For teams doing the <em>hard, heart-centered</em> work
  description_html: |
    <p>You’re a school, nonprofit, collective, or mission-driven organization committed to care, but the systems you work within often make that care hard to sustain. Maybe your team is stretched thin, navigating burnout, vicarious trauma, or unclear boundaries. Maybe your values are strong, but you’re unsure how to reflect them in your policies, culture, or programs.</p>
    <p>This work is for organizations like yours—ones rooted in service, equity, and impact—who want to move beyond survival mode and build structures that support collective well-being from the inside out.</p>
