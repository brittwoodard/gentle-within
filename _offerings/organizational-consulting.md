  heading_html: For teams doing the <em>hard, heart-centered</em> work
  description_html: |
    <p>You’re a school, nonprofit, collective, or mission-driven organization committed to care, but the systems you work within often make that care hard to sustain. Maybe your team is stretched thin, navigating burnout, vicarious trauma, or unclear boundaries. Maybe your values are strong, but you’re unsure how to reflect them in your policies, culture, or programs.</p>
    <p>This work is for organizations like yours—ones rooted in service, equity, and impact—who want to move beyond survival mode and build structures that support collective well-being from the inside out.</p>

  heading_html: <em>Frequently</em> Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: Are Ayurvedic consultations medical treatment?
     answer_html: |
       <p>No — Ayurvedic consultations are educational and wellness-oriented. They are not a substitute for licensed medical care or psychotherapy. These sessions are offered as part of my training in Ayurveda and are currently available at a sliding scale ($25–$50). If you’re seeking mental health support, please consider booking a psychotherapy session.</p>
   - question: Can I work with you for both therapy and Ayurveda?
     answer_html: |
       <p>It depends. Because of ethical and professional guidelines, I typically keep psychotherapy and Ayurvedic consultations separate. If you’re curious about integrating both approaches, we can discuss your goals during an initial call and determine the best path forward.</p>
   - question: Do you offer virtual or in-person sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>At this time, I offer virtual sessions via a secure, HIPAA-compliant video platform. In-person sessions may be available upon request, depending on location and availability.</p>
   - question: Do you offer sliding scale rates or pro bono sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Yes. I reserve a limited number of sliding scale therapy and Ayurvedic consultation spots for BIPOC, and low-income clients. Please inquire about current availability during your consultation call.</p>
   - question: How do I get started?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Head over to the Contact page to reach out. Let me know which service you're interested in, and I’ll follow up with next steps or a link to book a free consultation call.</p>
