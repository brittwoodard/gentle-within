  heading_html: Is Psychotherapy <em>right for you?</em>
  description_html: |
    <p>You may be carrying more than anyone realizes, anxiety that lingers beneath the surface, memories that feel too heavy to name, a constant pressure to hold it all together. Maybe you’re feeling disconnected from yourself, overwhelmed by relationships, or stuck in patterns you don’t know how to break.</p>
    <p>At Gentle Within, psychotherapy offers a space to slow down, be heard, and begin the work of healing—at your own pace, and in your own way. This work is for teens, adults, and couples ready to explore their inner world with support, care, and intention.</p>

  heading_html: What we <em>hold space</em> for
  description_html: |
    <p>At Gentle Within, therapy begins with honoring the weight of what you carry. That might be the lingering effects of trauma, patterns shaped by early attachment, or a nervous system stuck in survival mode. We move slowly, allowing space to process without pressure so that healing can happen at a pace that feels right.</p>
    <p>This is also a place to tend to grief, depression, and anxiety—experiences that can leave you feeling disconnected from yourself or overwhelmed by emotion. Together, we explore what's underneath, making room for self-understanding, regulation, and relief.</p>
    <p>Cultural identity and belonging are a vital part of this work. If you’ve felt unseen or unheard in other spaces, therapy here centers your lived experience. We invite the full complexity of who you are, your roots, your questions, your voice—into the room.</p>
    <p>Life doesn't pause for healing. Big changes, quiet burnout, shifts in relationships, they all ask something of us. This practice offers steady support through those transitions, helping you make sense of what’s unfolding and reconnect with the parts of you that may have gone quiet along the way.</p>

  heading_html: <em>Frequently</em> Asked Questions
  questions:
   - question: Are you currently accepting new therapy clients?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Yes, I am currently accepting a limited number of new clients for teens, individual and couples psychotherapy. Please reach out through the Contact page to schedule a free 15-minute consultation to see if we're a good fit.</p>
   - question: Do you offer virtual or in-person sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>At this time, I offer virtual sessions via a secure, HIPAA-compliant video platform. In-person sessions may be available upon request, depending on location and availability.</p>
   - question: Can I work with you for both therapy and Ayurveda?
     answer_html: |
       <p>It depends. Because of ethical and professional guidelines, I typically keep psychotherapy and Ayurvedic consultations separate. If you’re curious about integrating both approaches, we can discuss your goals during an initial call and determine the best path forward.</p>
   - question: Do you offer sliding scale rates or pro bono sessions?
     answer_html: |
       <p>Yes. I reserve a limited number of sliding scale therapy and Ayurvedic consultation spots for BIPOC, and low-income clients. Please inquire about current availability during your consultation call.</p>
   - question: How do I get started?
     answer_html: |
